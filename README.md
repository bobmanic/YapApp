# YapApp
An Android App RESTful client using Retrofit library from Square to communicate and consume RESTful resources from my Yap Webapp back end server. Also, attached Yap Web App backend server.

## Http Servlet Back End

A clone of my previous Yap-Yelp Web App project.

A simple Yelp ( http://www.yelp.com/ ) like business review and cataloging web app with REST API services.

Built using Java (1.7) Servlets and MySQL 6.5 Server. RESTful API services port out JSON data queried from database like Yelp API for further consumption by Android mobile app.

More about this project is discussed on my blog;

REST API JSON output format is inspired from Yelp's API behavior. More about it here;
